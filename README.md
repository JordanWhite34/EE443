Principal Component Analysis and Clustering Techniques

Problem 1: Principal Component Analysis (50%)
The first problem is about implementing PCA from scratch using the NumPy library. The project uses the ORL Face Data dataset for this problem. The following sub-tasks are completed:

Implement PCA using Python (1-(a))
Report the 5 largest eigenvalues (1-(b))
Plot the mean face and the eigenfaces corresponding to the 5 largest eigenvalues (1-(c))
Reconstruct the face with different numbers of eigenfaces (1-(d))
Output the 5 closest faces in the training dataset to the first 3 entries in the testing dataset (1-(e))
Problem 2: Clustering (50%)
The second problem is about implementing the k-Means clustering algorithm from scratch and using the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) clustering algorithm from the scikit-learn package. The project uses the MNIST database for this problem. The following sub-tasks are completed:

Implement the k-Means clustering algorithm using Python (2-(a))
Visualize the initial, first, and final step of the k-means clustering for the first 100 data points (2-(b))
Evaluate the classification accuracy on the 10,000 testing data (2-(c))
Experiment with different numbers of clusters and PCA dimension reduction (2-(d))
Implement GMM clustering algorithm and report the classification accuracy (2-(e))
Files
The repository contains the following files:

Python (.py) or Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) files with implementations for both Problem 1 and Problem 2
A PDF file containing code screenshots with sufficient comments, answers, and figures for all sub-tasks of both problems.
How to Run
To run the code, please follow these steps:

Clone the repository
Install the required libraries (NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn)
